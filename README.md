# shellshare

Live broadcast of terminal sessions.

## Why?

Ever wanted to quickly show what you're doing to some friends? Maybe you're seeing a weird error and would like some help. Or the other way around: some friend of yours is asking for help on something, then you start to ping-pong: you tell a command, he pastes the output, then you tell another, and so on...

The objective of [shellshare.net](https://shellshare.net) is to provide an easy way to broadcast your terminal live. No signups, no configurations, anything: simply run a command and you're good to go.

## Using

Copy and paste the following line in your terminal:

```
wget -qO shellshare https://get.shellshare.net && python shellshare
```

If you don't have `wget` installed (as in Mac OS X), you can use `curl` as:

```
curl -sLo shellshare https://get.shellshare.net && python shellshare
```

You'll see a line saying `Sharing session in
https://shellshare.net/r/h2Uont4F8bvZ8VDjHb` (your link will be different).
Anyone that opens this link will be able to see what you're doing in your
terminal. When you're done, type `exit` or hit CTRL+D.

## Installing

It requires Node 4.2.x (but should work with earlier versions), npm, Gulp and
MongoDB. Considering that these dependencies are installed on your local
machine, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). To
broadcast to this instance, use the `--server` option of the client, as
following:

```
./public/bin/shellshare --server localhost:3000
```

## Limitations

This project is intended for live broadcasts only. If you'd like to record your terminal, check [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org)
or [other terminal recording tools](https://github.com/topics/terminal-recording).
